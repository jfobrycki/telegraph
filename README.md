## Summary

This page is a companion to the <a href="https://jfobrycki.github.io/telegraph/" target="_blank">an interactive map curation</a> created to describe this telegraph chart from the <a href="https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3201p.ct000465/" target="_blank">Library of Congress</a>.

This curation was developed as part of <a href="https://newmapsplus.as.uky.edu/programs#MAP701" target="_blank">MAP701 "History of Critical Cartography"</a> that is part of the <a href="https://newmapsplus.as.uky.edu/" target="_blank">New Maps Plus program from the University of Kentucky</a>.

## Curation Themes

Several themes in this curation link to course readings from MAP701. These linkages are described in the <a href="https://jfobrycki.github.io/telegraph/" target="_blank">map curation</a>. Some of the main themes are highlighted below.

### Maps and power

The telegraph chart includes different representations of the United States and Europe. The United States map shows the expanse of the entire country and the map of Europe shows one single harbor. This representation conveys a message that the United States is more advanced and powerful. This interpretation is informed by discussions from<a href="https://www.routledge.com/Introducing-Human-Geographies/Cloke-Crang-Goodwin/p/book/9781444135350" target="_blank">Jeremy Crampton in the book chapter "The Power of Maps."</a>

This contrast between the political and bird's eye maps is also a form of persuasive mapping that is discussed by <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/books/HOC/HOC_V6/HOC_VOLUME6_P.pdf#page=40" target="_blank">Judith Tyner</a>. 

The concept of connections is a common theme throughout the chart, showing how different parts of the world are linked together by telegraph. This chart is a medium of power, which is a concept discussed by <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-40953-5_9" target="_blank">Marianna Pavlovskaya</a>. Locations in the world that are connected by telegraph are visualized on the various maps, demonstrating these locations have a greater importance as determined by the mapmaker.

### Maps cartographic types

This telegraph chart includes multiple mapping scalesm most commonly small and medium scale maps, and several cartographic styles, including charting, topographic, and chorographic. The development of these three cartographic modes is <a href="https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/D13V-8318-8632-18K6" target="_blank">discussed by Matthew Edney</a>.

### Maps as a shared resource

One prominent feature in the telegraph chart is a collection of clocks from around the world, and each clock shows the respective local time. One interpretation of the global clock can be as an prototype of volunteered geographic information, as each telegraph operator could contribute to a larger global dataset of time. The important role of volunteered geographic information for more recent map efforts is <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-008-9186-0" target="_blank">discussed by Sarah Elwood</a>. 

### Maps as a conversation

Maps are a discussion between the viewer and the mapmaper, and it is the viewer that determines whether a map is a map as discussed by <a href="https://utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/E4K6-P241-184J-6452" target="_blank">Denis Wood</a>.

This telegraph chart also includes a separate conversation with the telegraph messages between Queen Victoria and President Buchanan. Including this conversation conveys to the viewer the importance of the telegraph lines crossing the Atlantic Ocean. By including this conversation on the chart itself, the mapmaker seems to suggest to the viewer that since the President and Queen took this event to be of great importance, the viewer should also view this chart as an object of great importance too.

## Curation Creation Process

This curation consists of an index.html file that includes HTML and Javascript. The primary libraries used are <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" target="_blank">Leaflet</a> and <a href="https://jquery.com" target="_blank">JQuery</a>. The original image is loaded from the Library of Congress and read into the index.html file using the <a href="https://github.com/mejackreed/Leaflet-IIIF" target="_blank">Leaflet IIIF plugin</a>.
