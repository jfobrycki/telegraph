        The telegraph fundamentally changed communication as information could be shared through cables rather than
        letters.
        <br><br>
        During the 1850s, the transatlantic telegraph cable was placed between Valentia Bay in Ireland and Trinity Bay
        in Newfoundland.

        Welcome to the first stop! This is a political map of the United States that shows the distribution of telegraph
        lines.
        <br><br>
        Note how most of the telegraph lines stop just west of Illinois.
        <br><br>
        The United States is displayed using a political map with state and territory boundaries.

    <div id="inset_two">
        Welcome to the second stop! This is a bird's eye view map of the telegraph station in Europe.
        <br><br>
        This map is a strong contrast to the previous map of the United States. The telegraph line links Europe and
        North America, but consider the way that the United States is shown using an up-to-date political map and Europe
        is shown using a general thematic pastoral type image.
        <br><br>
        The United States map shows the expanse of the entire country and the map of Europe shows one single harbor.
        This representation conveys a message that the United States is more advanced and powerful. This interpretation is informed by the <a href="https://www.routledge.com/Introducing-Human-Geographies/Cloke-Crang-Goodwin/p/book/9781444135350" target="_blank">book chapter "The Power of Maps" by Jeremy Crampton</a> and this contrast between the political and bird's eye maps is also a form of persuasive mapping that is informed by <a href="https://press.uchicago.edu/books/HOC/HOC_V6/HOC_VOLUME6_P.pdf#page=40" target="_blank">Judith Tyner's discussion of persuasive cartography</a>. 
        <br><br>
        Next we'll consider the four ways this chart displays the telegraph line itself.

        Welcome to the third stop! At the top of this chart is the first of four ways the telegraph line is shown.
        <br><br>
        Trinity Bay in Newfoundland is positioned in such a way that the location seems to align with the United States
        map below to the left.
        <br><br>
        This map of the telegraph cable route is thematic, and does not provide any additional context relative to the
        ocean, particularly since the background here is a flag. The telegraph line is a dashed line drawn from one side
        of the chart to the other.

    <div id="inset_four">
        Welcome to the fourth stop! Here's the second telegraph map.
        <br><br>
        This map looks more like a charting map that traces the path of the telegraph line and the ships that carried
        the cables. The map is also drawn using a small scale to show entire contients and much of the world. However,
        there are medium scale mapping elements included, such as noting the presence of major population centers around
        the world.
        <br><br>
        Note the different color schemes used in the map. Europe is filled with a blue/green color and the rest the
        world is not filled in. This is a color theme that will appear in another part of the chart, though you'll find
        a potential error with this color scheme. Ready for the second telegraph line map! Please click next stop!
        <div id="next_stop">
            <button id="next_stop_four"
                onclick="map.flyTo([-270, 54.75], 3); $('#inset_four').hide(); $('#inset_five').show();">Next

    </div>

    <div id="inset_five">
        Welcome to the fifth stop! Here's the third telegraph map.
        <br><br>
        Now we've returned to a medium scale map in which mutiple cities are noted in Newfoundland and Nova Scotia. The
        blue color has returned, though this time Newfoundland is shaded blue the color that was previously used for
        Europe.
        <br><br>
        In this map, the telegraph line is of primary importance and the map includes the primary trans-Atlantic line
        and also several lines in Canada. This map demonstrates how the new line links up to an existing network within
        Canada and the United States. It's not just two bays linked by the new telegraph line, it's multiple cities and
        countries.
        <br><br>
        This map again crosses the entire chart with a dashed line linking the left and right sides of the page. Let's
        follow the route again!
        <div id="follow_route">
            <button
                onclick="map.flyTo([-240.125, 380.625], 3.5); $('#inset_five').hide(); $('#inset_five_part_two').show();">Follow
                the route</button>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div id="inset_five_part_two">
        The dashed red telegraph line has crossed the chart over to Europe. We see a range of telegraph lines that link
        Ireland to England and then onto continental Europe. The concept of connections is a common theme throughout this chart, showing how different parts of the world are linked together by telegraph. This chart is a medium of power, which is a concept discussed by <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-40953-5_9" target="_blank">Marianna Pavlovskaya</a>. Locations in the world that are connected by telegraph are visualized on the various maps, demonstrating these locations have a greater importance as determined by the mapmaker.
        <br><br>
        Given the attention paid to showing how this telegraph line links the two continents, it's interesting there's
        no actual line drawn here that links the trans-Atlantic cable to other lines in Ireland.

        The fourth telegraph map is a profile topographic map that shows how the ocean depth varies across the North
        Atlantic ocean.
        <br><br>
        No units are given on this map, and it is drawn at a small scale. The units are likely drawn in fathoms. This
        map is more art than navigation device as some depths such as 2000 and 1580 seem to have similar heights.
        Now the tour moves to other aspects of the chart, please click next stop to see!

        Welcome to the seventh stop!
        <br><br>
        The global clock is central feature on this chart. The blue color scheme returns, but the color distinctions
        don't match the split between Europe and other continents as occurs in the map above. Instead, the clock colors
        are based on their location. The outer and inner circles of clocks are blue.
        <br><br>
        Global timezones were not in effect during the late 1850s. We can assume each clock shows the local time. The
        emphasis on an American audience is demonstrated through having the New York City clock serve as the center
        point of the entire display.
        <br><br>
        Bordering the clocks are illustrations of the two ships used to lay the telegraph cable across the Atlantic
        Ocean, the Niagara and the Agamemnon.
        <br><br>
        The global timepiece highlights the transformative role the telegraph has in linking different locations and
        times together. One interpretation of the global clock can be as an prototype of volunteered geographic information, as each telegraph operator could contribute to a larger global dataset of time. The important role of volunteered geographic information for more recent map efforts is <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10708-008-9186-0" target="_blank">discussed by Sarah Elwood</a>.

        This portion of the chart includes a general representation of the Earth, presumably showing North America in
        daylight.
        <br><br>
        This portion of the chart emphasizes the global, historic implications of this event by including the telegraph
        messages sent between Queen Victoria and President Buchanan.
        <br><br>
        Some key phrases noted by President Buchanan included that the telegraph should "prove to be a bond of perpetual
        peace and friendship" and that all nations "shall be forever neutral (to telegraph communications), and that its
        communications shall be held sacred in pass to their places of destination, even in the midst of hostilities."

    <div id="inset_nine">
        Welcome to the ninth stop!
        <br><br>
        Here we see another general representation of the Earth, but the continents shown appear to be the same North
        American continent shown on the other side of the chart. Conceptually, it seems like these globes were intended
        to show how communication regardless of time of day, but the representation of the continents leads to some
        confusion.
        <br><br>
        The historic importance of this global event is again reinforced by including Queen Victoria's message to
        President Buchanan. As discussed by <a href="https://utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/E4K6-P241-184J-6452" target="_blank">Denis Wood</a>, a map becomes a map through a conversation between the viewer and the mapmaker. This telegraph chart provides an additional conversation within the map itself between the President and the Queen. Including this conversation conveys to the viewer the importance of the mapped event.
        <br><br>
        Some key phrases noted by Queen Victoria included that the telegraph should "prove an additional link betwen the
        nations whose friendship is founded upon their common interest and reciprocal esteem."

        Welcome to the final stop!
        <br><br>
        We've journeyed around this chart and seen how the telegraph was shown as a triumphant event with a specific
        emphasis as a triumphant American event. Though England is also recognized, the way in which the United States
        is depicted in map in the upper right conveys a message of technology advancement that is lacking in the bird's
        eye view map.
        <br><br>
        Multiple mapping scales are used, most commonly small and medium scale maps, and several styles are used,
        including charting, topographic, and chorographic. The development of these three cartographic modes is <a href="https://www.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/D13V-8318-8632-18K6" target="_blank">discussed by Matthew Edney</a>.
        <br><br>
        That this was an important international event is further reinforced by including the telegraph messages between
        President Buchanan and Queen Victoria. This chart looks like an official document, even with the wording
        "Entered according to act of Congress in the year 1858 by Charles Magnus and Co."
        <br><br>
        As for the telegraph cable? It ceased working a few months after it first started operation. More telegraph
        lines continued to be established across the Atlantic Ocean and communication continued. These efforts are
        detailed on several sites, including <a href="https://atlantic-cable.com/" target="_blank">this one</a>.
